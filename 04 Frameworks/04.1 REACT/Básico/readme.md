## 02 Web Boiler plate

## Summary

In this example there is a webpack boiler plate set up with Typescript support, just in the step before
to adding React support.

It is based on the Webpack examples.

This example is the only one that doesn't have a step-by-step (if you need guidance, you can go to the
webpack examples you'll find in this repository).

Highlights:

- The webpackconfig has the src folder configured, and the loaders to handle typescript.
- We have babel and typescript configuration files.
- We do the transpilation using babel.

In the following example we will take this as a starting point and we will go step by step adding
support for React.
